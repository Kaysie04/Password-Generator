# Password-Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a randomly generated password based on selected criteria by the user.
The criteria included length (8-128 characters,) uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
The user was guided through a series of prompts to choose what criteria they wanted. 
Atleast one character type had to be selected or the user was prompted to try again.
After all prompts were answered, a password was displayed that met the criteria that the user selected.
